To serve the `hello.html` file using the static file middleware in Express, you can make the following adjustments to your code:

1. Ensure that the `hello.html` file is located in a directory specified for static file serving. Let's assume the `hello.html` file is located in a directory named `public`. 

2. Modify your Express app to use the static file middleware and specify the `public` directory as the source of static files:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the "public" directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

3. Move the `hello.html` file to the `public` directory.

After making these changes, you should be able to access the `hello.html` file by accessing the application with the file name in the URL, like this: `http://localhost:3000/hello.html`.

The static file middleware will serve the `hello.html` file from the specified directory, treating it the same way it treated the `index.html` file.
